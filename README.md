# DIXIT CLIENT

_This project is part of the **"You have to start somewhere"** React Project Series_

Following the boardgame Dixit, this project has the client logic for the game.
You will also need the server, which you can [find here](https://github.com/Hans010/dixit-server-playground)

It is built on a MERN stack.

The project is still in development.

## Installation

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

To install multiple clients on local server, just start the client in different ports.
